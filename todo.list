ACM to-do list.
Please put a 'B' (if you're Borlak) or a 'P' (if you're Pip) in the boxes below
when finished with that task.

[ ] update the "press enter to continue" to show how many lines there are to go, and have
    extra options like pressing "q" for quit or "b" for back.  that code in process_output
    looks messy as crap.. take a close look at it
[ ] finish shops -- new money thing i added
[b] check out resets .. do we REALLY need subresets? maybe just put them underneath main resets
[p] banks - a place to store all objects actually
[bp] wizard commands.. set, stat, goto, invis, etc. etc.
[b] updaters....timers...
[b] put in all the help files for OLC .. name ? etc

[B] updating player states (unconscious, sitting -- and corresponding commands)
[B] add a bugs and suggest command - just text dump to a bugs.player and suggest.player list?
[B] sort 'standard' exits in a specific way.  north,east,south,west,up,down always in that order
    make sure there are no 'N' exits, should always say "north".. think this is done already
    -- done with a dynamic order by statement in fread_exits.. so a reboot may be required before
       a room shows "correct" exits.  shouldn't be a problem most for "open" areas :)
[B] why are there 'north' 'south' commands etc.  should go through the exit list and use a
    generic move_char type function -- guess its been too long, this is already the case, I
    guess we had the "commands" so "n" would come before any other command, but it should
    already be searching room exits FIRST in the interpreter.. so I commented it out for now
[B] made 'config' borders dynamic.. hehe!
// Since 11-17-2007
[B] change all functions to use xobj and xcrit instead of obj and xcrit.. 
[B] look at coins again , not sure I like how they are done..

 -- Docs!
[ ] MySQL, show the manual commands, how to get to it, how to install it, etc.. 
[ ] Codebase 'flow'
[ ] Give examples of things people may want to do - such as pip's players personal shops!
                                                  - layers on equipment

 -- Stuff new coders will want to do
[ ] Combat
[ ] scripting language
[ ] affects
[ ] auction
[ ] weather system. - persistant
[ ] user definable colors for chats, tells..
[ ] run the DB saving(mysql) on a separate process (or program?).. repeat 10000 save will lag the mud
[ ] switch to iodbc/postgre - no mysql -- free yourself from GPL
[ ] maybe an easier/more fluid way to do connection states/character creation
