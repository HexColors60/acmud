The town lies to the south.

Virgin Terrace~
Oil lamps illuminate this part of Virgin terrace. A tremendous amount of traffic flows westward toward some stores. To the east, several intersections can be seen. A runaway shelter humbly sits to the south. A dark alleyway leads north.

Virgin Terrace~
Throngs of people walk quickly by the windows of Virgin Terrace, peering into them. Women behind the windows beckon the people and animals on the street to purchase their services. Candi's Corner, to the west, seems particularly busy. To the north, Sticky's Pages sells exotic literature. A seedy building is set to the south.

Story Room~
Well, there isn't much to say here. Mab and Thoreau were contemplating building this zone for a long, long time for PK Mud. With the help of Rip and some other flaps, they worked their idea out one March week in Los Angeles. Over the next few months, using Make.Zones.Fast, the two wrote this zone.

Probably the two most profound contributions of this zone are the interweaved canal system which runs throughout the zone and the cheesy "Pyschadelic" air part of the zone. The canal system allows players to zip around the zone and permits another easy connection to the main MUD. The air part is more complicated because it requires flying.

Feel free to take snipets of this zone and implement them into your mud as you choose. Just, please, include this room as a tribute to Mab and Thoreau's generousity.
