                               History of ACM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- August 30, 2001: Removed my own license and am putting the mud under the
OGL, or Open Gaming License, created by Wizards of the Coast.  Also, I am
basing the mud "systems" off of Wizard's System Reference Document.  See
Bibliography for websites.

-- August 29, 2001: Added signal handling.  Mud now has built-in check for
infinite loop and will abort when one is detected.  Improved mud sleeping; it
now does #loops/second and divides up the time evenly.  Added races, classes,
skills in character structure.

-- August 15, 2001: Removed room prototyping.

-- August 9, 2001: Ported ACM to Windows.  Bibliography added in /doc.  os.h and
os.c added.  Added non-blocking to sockets.

-- July 21, 2001:  Randon number generator added.  Licence added.

-- July 20, 2001:  Converting area function done.  Reading areas now possible.

-- July 15, 2001:  Renamed the mud from minimud to ACM (A C Mud).

-- July 14, 2001:  Added merc-area to minimud-area converter function
(convert.c).

-- July 2001:  I'm back to modifying this code.  I have fixed all known bugs,
and am creating a more solid skeletal/barebones codebase to release to the
public.

-- April 2000:  This mud was entered into Erwin Andreasen's 16k mud competition
(http://www.andreasen.org/16k.shtml), and got last place!  Kind of going off
base, I decided to make a mud that would be good for the community.  Easy to
modify, familiar design (MERC).  The goal of the contest was to make the most
"fun" mud out of 16k.  I had a chat server :)  With bugs in fact!  I didn't find
out until later, even after numerous thank-you emails, that I left in a
terrible bug (also a harmless one).  I had not used ->prev and ->next pointers
in linked lists (MERC just uses ->next), and I made the mistake of forgetting to
initialize ->prev in my linked list macros.
